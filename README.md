# JSX

- JSX (Javascript Extension) - JSX is the convention to merge HTML and JS together
- JSX is not HTML, instead it has HTML or XML like syntax
- JSX is not part of React
- JSX is not pure JS as JS Engine cannot understand JSX
- JSX transpiled before reaches the JS Engine means converts the code to some other code
  which browser can understand
- Transpiling is done by Babel which is part of Parcel Package
- JSX -> Babel-> React.createElement() -> ReactElement(JS Object) -> HTMLElement(On Render)
- Babel is the transpiler or JS compiler
- If you want to give attributes to JSX, we must use camelCase
- Prevents Cross Site Scripting (malicious) attacks by sanitizing the data before evaluation JS Expression in {}

# React Component

- Everything in react is a react component
- Class Based Component - Old Way
- Functional Component - New Way
- Functional Component - It is a JS function which returns some piece of JSX
- Must start with CAPITAL LETTER

# Component Composition

- Putting One Component into other component is called component composition

# Props

- Props means properties
- Passing props to a react component is same as passing arguments to a function
- React says Never use indexes as keys as it will cause performance hit
- Not Using Keys (Not Acceptable) <<< Index as keys <<<<<<<<< Unique Id (Best Practices)

# Config Driven UI

- Is the UI which is based on config which is coming from backend
- Suppose, different states in India have different offers or no offers , so based on that
  in backend API, our Frontend UI changes

# Hooks

- useParams is given by React Router
- useMemo - which increases the performance of the app
